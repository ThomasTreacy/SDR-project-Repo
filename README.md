# SDR-project-Repo

Code used for my capstone research project, "Software Defined Radio for Solar Radio Physics". Please see scripts with "Code for SDR Project" in description, and also "dynamic_spectra_soapy_test.py" and "run_sdr_day_1.sh". Everything else is either a test or earlier work in progress versions of code finally used.
